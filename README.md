# lidar_threejs_playground
exploring lidar data from self-driving cars with three.js and other methods

in progress.....

Will populate with a bunch of other things I researched or tried and found didn't work. Most of the JavaScript only viewers for Lidar data are written for GIS lidar, which is often in different formats and shot with different hardware.
